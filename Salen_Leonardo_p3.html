                        &emsp;&emsp;After experiencing my 1st computer class, 
                        I gain the knowledge of how a group leader work 
                        and what is the meaning of leadership the quotes
                        that I remember is " A Competent Leader can get e
                        fficient service from poor troops. While on the 
                        contrary, an incapable leader can demoralize the 
                        best of troops.- John J. Pershing This first 
                        semester of the class has provided me with 
                        a wealth of information.
                    </h2>
                    <h2 class="center">
                        &emsp;&emsp;I understand how to lead a small team, It feels like after we graduate from senior 
                        high we're going on the field to do work. That's really what I want
                        gaining more knowledge in the time of senior high and got a job after graduating senior high.
                        It teaches us what does it means to be a leader, or what it takes to be a leader
                        a competitive leader or what you called a good leader. As well as how to Lead
                        Workplace Communication. 
                    </h2>
                    <h2 class="center">
                        &emsp;&emsp;The next thing I learn is how to negotiate in the workplace or in anything that 
                        needed to negotiate. In how to develop and practice negotiation skill that helps me on 
                        how to handle a conversation that results on what I'm expecting. It teaches us to on what
                        are the 5 negotiation skills, Example of negotiation skill is Persuasion, persuasion is 
                        a really important part of a negotiation process that leads us to what result we want. I 
                        feel like when I gain and further develop my Negotiation skill is like I'm a powerful 
                        person that can win any negotiation or any argument and leads it to the way I want. I 
                        thought it be easy to develop my negotiation skill but it's a really hard path but it's 
                        worth it when you gain it you can use it anything you want but just using on good ways 
                        not on scamming people you'll rather get killed by a person you scam or go to join when 
                        you get lucky at first you get out easily on those things you do.

                        &emsp;&emsp;On the other hand, is confusing I thought I can't understand it even it discusses with us 
                        but It's confusing at first but if you give an effort you can understand it. It's easy 
                        to understand this lesson is Math the things that a lot of us hate because it feels like
                         math is the big wall we need to overcome. But almost all things are using math. It makes
                         me hard to understand this, Although it's just brief math and easy math it's not hard 
                        like pre-calculus that can make your head spin. 
                    </h2>
                    <h2 class="center">
                        &emsp;&emsp;This thing is the one that I love to learn and fun to learn on how Microsoft Visual 
                        Basic for application or VBA. It teaches us a lot of things on Excel terms, comment, 
                        array, function, and a lot of things but it's fun and worth it to learn like you do a
                         lot of things easily and efficient and less time needed because you automatic solve 
                        everything that needed no need for manually type it and solve it.
                    </h2>
                    <h2 class="center">
                        &emsp;&emsp;This is the real thing that I want to learn and want to have always in our 
                        discussion in Programming although it's just the beginning of the lesson that 
                        I already learn in my self-study but it's fun and I feel like I can understand 
                        it more and focus on it. Even I self-study in programming halfway on it I'll 
                        always stop and back to my habit that's why it's hard for me to fully understand
                        all of the concepts but when that thing is discussing in school, I feel like I 
                        need to focus on it and needed to understand all of the concepts my bad habit isn't
                        working on that thing when it's for school.

                        The programming. I expect in the next sem we deep in programming and 
                        I gain more knowledge on it.
